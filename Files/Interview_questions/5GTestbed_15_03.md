Here are the below questions which are asked in 5G Testbed Technical Round-1

1.Can you briefly explain about Your-self.
2.In the market we have so many processors then why are you using only ARM Cortex M4 ?
ans: Among all the Processor ARM Cortex M4 have higher performance,power efficiency and low cost than all others. For that purpose I am using ARM Cortex M4.
3. What are the serieses available in ARM ?
sol: ARM Cortex M,A,R serieses are available.
4. Do you have any experience on any microcontroller other than STM32 ?
sol: No
5. WAP to count the no.of consecutive 1's in a given number using only bitwise operator and c program?

**** During program implementation ****
6. By modifying the same code, implement it by using Threads ?
7. Debug the code by using the GDB ?

8. When will this  type of errors are occured ?
/tmp/cckc1kf6.o: In function `main':
bit.c:(.text+0x57): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
bit.c:(.text+0x83): undefined reference to `pthread_join'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

ans: We have to compile the code with -lpthread When we are using the thread in a program ?
