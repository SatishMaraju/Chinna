1) Self Introduction

2) About the B.Tech project.
Ans: The main purpose of this project is to control the vehicle speed automatically when the specific zones are reached like schools,hospitals,college etc.
3) How the Vehicles knows it is a zone or not ?
Ans: In the specific zones we have to arrange the RFID transmitters which radiats the Radio Frequency signals continously.
4) How the vehicle detect the RFID signals ?Is it a 2 wheeler or anything?
Ans: In the Vehicle i have arranged the RFID Tag which is responsible of controlling the vehicle speed and it detects the RFID transmitted signals. It is for $ wheelers.
5) How the vehicle wheels stops running ?
Ans. Through DC Motors.
6) Which protocol is used in this project ?
Ans: ZigBee protocol.
7) What is the difference  between Thread and Task ?
Ans: A thread is a lighrt weight process and is the part of the process. For every thread it creates The stack memory and the threads are run sequentially.
Task: A Task is an individual execution of the event. It is used in RTOS. It can runthe multiple Tasks at a time.
8) What is the major difference in practically ?
9) What is the difference between HAL_Delay() and osDelay() ?
Ans: Whenever we are using the haldelay() it waits till the particular time is completed but the osDelay() can't wait until the completion of the time.haldelay() can wait the 10msec time whenever the condition is false but where as the ossdelay() cant wait until the completion of the 10msec.
10) Why the osDelay() cant wait untill the completion of the time ?
11) Tell me practically ?
12) What is the difference between CISC andd RISC ?
Ans: CISC have more no.of instructions where as RISC have Less no.of instructons. RISC have standard instruction size where the CISC have variable size.
13) What type of architecture does ARM have ?
Ans. It is a RISC architecture and has the more performance than CISC.
14) Implement the Circular Linked List ?
