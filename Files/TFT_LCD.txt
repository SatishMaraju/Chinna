Q. Interface a 1.8 inch Color SPI TFT module (ST7735) with an STM32F401RBT6 controller.

sol:	1. Here the first thiing we need to observe is that the SPI in STM32F401RBT6 is connected to ST7735 TFT LCD.For that we need to create a program in HAL based on SPI protocol 			requirements using STM32 CubeMX (STM32F401RBT6 is connected to ST7735 TFT LCD through SPI).
	
	2. The ST7735 TFT LCD is connected to SPI like below.
		i). LED :: Backlight -> Connect to 3.3V
		ii). SCK :: Serial clock input -> connect to SPI SCK pin
		iii). SDA :: Serial data input -> Connect to SPI MOSI pin
		iv). DC :: Data/Command selection -> Connect to PA9
		v). RESET :: Reset -> Connect to PC7
		vi). CS :: Chip Select -> Connect to PB6
		vii). GND :: Ground -> GND
		viii). VCC :: Power Supply -> 3.3V

	3. We need to download ST7735 driver code in google.(font.c,font.h,st7735.h,st7735.c,GFX_FUNCTIONS.h and GFX_FUNCTIONS.c)
	
	4. Here DC is Connected to SPI1 DC at GPIOA 0,RST at GPIOA 1 and CS at GPIOA 4.

	5. After that attach those .c and .h files which are acquired from ST7735 driver (like .c files attached in arc and .h files in inc).

	6. In HAL main program,we need to include the below
		ST7735_SetRotation(0);
  		ST7735_WriteString(x-axis, y-axis, "KERNEL MASTERS", Font_11x18, RED,BLACK);
  		HAL_Delay(1000);
  		fillScreen(BLACK);
	
	7. If we want to change the font then we have to change the resolution like below.
		extern FontDef Font_7x10; // small size text
		extern FontDef Font_11x18;  //medium size text
		extern FontDef Font_16x26;  //large size text

	8. If we want to change the colours then we have to make changes in below.
		ST7735_WriteString( , , , ,colour,colour);

	9. If we want to rotate the screen for printing, make changes in below function call like
		ST7735_SetRotation(0);
		---> 0 indicates the up-side of display.
		---> 1 indicates the right-side of display.
		---> 2 indicates the down-side of display.
		---> 3 indicates the left-side of display.
	
	10. If we want to change the screen background colour, we have to make changes like
		fillScreen(colour);
		in colour--we have to mention the colour name.

ISSUES: 1. The DC pin is not mentioned, for that i'm not included DC pin.
	sol: We arrange The GPIOA pin 0.
	2. Some files are missed while adding.
	sol: Make sure that all the .c files are attached at src and .h files in inc.
	3. I'm not getting the output.
	sol: for that i have checked the rayanmini datasheets to know the pins which are connected to the TFT_LCD through SPI.
