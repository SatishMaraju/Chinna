Ex: input "    hello world.   "

rtrim- "hello world.   "

ltrim- "    hello world"

trim- "hello world".

24.    Append the contents of one file to other

25.   Check whether little endian or big endian

26.   sort the input string

Ex: ip- helloworld               Op- dehllloorw



27.   convert string into integers

Input :one two three four five

Output : 12345

Take string as input one two three print as 123
